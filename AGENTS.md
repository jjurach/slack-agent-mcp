## Decision Tree: When to Create a Project Plan

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Use this decision tree for EVERY user request:

```
User Request Received
    │
    ├─ Is it a question or information request only?
    │   ├─ YES → Answer directly, no plan needed
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next step
    │
    ├─ Does it modify existing code?
    │   ├─ YES → Create project plan (REQUIRED)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next step
    │
    ├─ Does it create new files/features?
    │   ├─ YES → Create project plan (REQUIRED)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next step
    │
    ├─ Does it modify database schema?
    │   ├─ YES → Create project plan (REQUIRED)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next step
    │
    └─ Is it a trivial change? (see Trivial Changes section)
        ├─ YES → Use simplified change documentation only
        └─ NO → Create project plan (REQUIRED)
```

**If unsure, default to creating a project plan.**

---

## Trivial Changes Exception

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** The following changes may skip the full project plan process but still require simplified change documentation:

### Qualifying Trivial Changes:
1. **Typo/Spelling Corrections**
   - Single word corrections
   - No functional impact
   - Example: Fixing "deprication" → "depreciation" in comments

2. **Formatting-Only Changes**
   - Whitespace adjustments
   - Indentation fixes
   - Line break adjustments
   - No code logic changes

3. **Single-Line Bug Fixes**
   - Obvious syntax errors
   - Missing semicolons, brackets, etc.
   - No dependencies affected
   - No architectural changes

4. **Documentation-Only Updates**
   - README updates
   - Comment improvements
   - No code changes

### Simplified Change Documentation for Trivial Changes:
```markdown
# Trivial Change: [Brief Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  
**Type:** Trivial [Typo/Formatting/Bug Fix/Documentation]  
**Status:** Completed

## Change Made
Brief description of the trivial change.

## Files Modified
- `path/to/file.ext` - [Description]

## Notes
Any relevant context.
```

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** For trivial changes, create the simplified documentation AFTER making the change, not before.

---

## Core Development Principles

### 1. **Documentation First**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** 
- **ALL changes must be documented** before implementation (except trivial changes - see above)
- Create a new markdown file for each change with detailed descriptions
- Track what files were modified and what changes were made
- Include before/after code snippets when applicable
- Use the exact template provided in this document

### 2. **Project Planning Required**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **NO code changes without a project plan** (unless trivial - see exceptions above)
- Create a new detailed project plan for each requested change
- Include step-by-step implementation approach
- Define success criteria and testing requirements
- **WAIT for developer approval** before executing any plan
- Update project plan showing completed steps once complete

**What Counts as "Approval":**
- Explicit words: "approved", "proceed", "go ahead", "yes", "ok", "start"
- Implicit approval: User says "begin", "start", "implement"
- NOT approval: User asking questions, requesting clarification, or reviewing the plan

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** If the user responds to your project plan with anything other than explicit approval, DO NOT proceed. Wait for clear approval.

### 3. **Change Tracking System**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Store all change documentation in `dev_notes/` directory
- Use timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_description.md` (24-hour format, local timezone)
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Maintain chronological order of changes
- Link related changes and project plans

**Timestamp Format Rules:**
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`
- Use 24-hour time format
- Use local timezone
- Example: `2024-01-15_14-30-00`
- Get current timestamp using: `date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"` (Unix) or equivalent

│   ├── 2024-01-15_15-40-00_reporting-system-plan.md
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** 
- Create `dev_notes/` directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Use exact timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` (24-hour format)

## Critical Rules

### **NEVER Execute Without Approval**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** This is the MOST IMPORTANT rule.

- All project plans MUST be approved before implementation
- No code changes without explicit developer consent
- If unsure, ask for clarification
- **Exception:** Trivial changes (see Trivial Changes section)

**AI AGENT DECISION POINT:** Before making ANY code change, ask yourself:
1. Is this a trivial change? → If yes, proceed with simplified docs
2. Do I have explicit approval? → If no, STOP and request approval
3. Am I certain about the approach? → If no, ask for clarification

### **Always Document Changes**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Documentation is mandatory.

- Every file modification must be documented
- Include clear descriptions of what was changed
- Maintain chronological order of changes
- Link to project plans when applicable

### **Maintain Code Quality**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Follow these quality standards.

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure python types are properly defined (e.g., TypeScript, Python type hints)
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code style (check other files first)

### **Test Before Proceeding**
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Verify changes work.

- Test each change before moving to the next step
- Verify that existing functionality still works
- Check for any breaking changes
- Run linters/type checkers if available
- If testing is not possible, clearly state this in documentation

## Database Changes

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Special procedures for database modifications.

### Schema Changes
1. **ALWAYS** create a migration script
2. Document the migration in project plan
3. Include rollback procedures
4. Test migration on sample data first

### Migration Script Format
```sql
-- Migration: [Description]
-- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
-- Related Project Plan: [plan-id]

-- Forward migration
BEGIN;
-- Your migration SQL here
COMMIT;

-- Rollback (if needed)
-- BEGIN;
-- Rollback SQL here
-- COMMIT;
```

**AI AGENT CHECKLIST for Database Changes:**
- [ ] Migration script created
- [ ] Rollback script included
- [ ] Migration documented in project plan
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Backup strategy considered

---

## API Development

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Follow these practices for API endpoints.

### Endpoint Documentation
- Document all new/modified endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Specify error codes and messages
- Document authentication requirements

### API Documentation Template
```markdown
## [Endpoint Name]

**Method:** [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]  
**Path:** `/api/v1/[path]`  
**Authentication:** [Required/Optional]

### Request
```json
{
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2"
}
```

### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}
```

### Response (Error)
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```
```

**AI AGENT CHECKLIST for API Changes:**
- [ ] Endpoint documented
- [ ] Request/response examples provided
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Authentication considered
- [ ] Validation added

## Emergency Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Follow these steps immediately.

1. **STOP immediately** - Do not continue with changes
2. **Document the issue** - Create a change log entry explaining what happened
3. **Notify the developer** - Explain what happened clearly
4. **Wait for guidance** - Do not attempt to fix without approval

### Rollback Procedures
**AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** Only execute with explicit approval.

1. **Identify the last working state** - Check git history or documentation
2. **Create a rollback plan** - Document what needs to be reverted
3. **Get developer approval** - Wait for explicit go-ahead
4. **Execute rollback carefully** - One step at a time
5. **Document the rollback process** - Create change documentation

## AI Agent Quick Reference

### Before Making ANY Code Change, Ask:
1. ✅ Is this a trivial change? (If yes, use simplified docs)
2. ✅ Do I have a project plan? (If no, create one)
3. ✅ Do I have explicit approval? (If no, STOP and request)
4. ✅ Do I understand the requirements? (If no, ask questions)
5. ✅ Have I checked existing code patterns? (If no, check first)

### Mandatory Workflow:
```
Request → Analysis → Plan → Approval → Implementation → Documentation
```

### File Naming:
- Project Plans: `dev_notes/project_plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_description.md`
- Changes: `dev_notes/changes/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_description.md`
- Branches: `feature/YYYY-MM-DD-description` or `fix/YYYY-MM-DD-description`

### Commit Format:
```
[Type] Brief description - Related to project plan: [plan-id]
```
