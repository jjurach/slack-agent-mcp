# Planning Document Templates

This document provides templates for planning documents used in the Google Personal MCP Server project.

## Agent Kernel Templates

The project follows the Agent Kernel template system. For complete template documentation, see:

- **[Template Structure Guide](system-prompts/templates/structure.md)** - Standard templates for project plans, architecture decisions, and investigation reports

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Development Notes Directory

Development notes and session transcripts are stored in `dev_notes/` using the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_description.md
```

Examples:
- `dev_notes/specs/2026-01-27_14-30-00_oauth-scope-upgrade.md`
- `dev_notes/project_plans/2026-01-27_16-45-00_documentation-integration-plan.md`

### Planning Documents

When creating project plans, follow the structure from the Agent Kernel:

1. **Executive Summary** - Overview and objectives
2. **Issues Summary** - Problems being addressed
3. **Implementation Phases** - Step-by-step breakdown
4. **Critical Files Summary** - Files to create, modify, or delete
5. **Verification Steps** - Testing and validation
6. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
7. **Risk Mitigation** - Known risks and mitigation strategies

### MCP Development Plans

For MCP tool development, include:

- **Tool Signature** - Input schema and expected outputs
- **Google API Integration** - Which APIs will be used
- **Authentication Requirements** - OAuth scopes needed
- **Testing Strategy** - Mock patterns for Google APIs
- **CLI Integration** - How the tool maps to CLI commands

### Architecture Decision Records

When documenting architectural decisions, include:

- **Context** - What problem are we solving?
- **Options Considered** - Alternative approaches
- **Decision** - What we chose and why
- **Consequences** - Expected impacts
